$From Mildred Katherine Pope's 1934 "From Latin to Modern French"
$We follow exactly the order as stipulated in Chapter II starting on page 72, with some input from other chapters where appropriate
$However, she explains in her elaboration chapters some places where clearly the order is not what it is listed as in Chapter 4,
$ ... so we implement those instead

$Characteristics of Classical Latin as per Pope page 75
n̪ > ŋ / __ [+hi,+back,-cont]
ɡ > ŋ / __ [+nas,+cor]

$ CORRECTION: We delete Pope's handling of Classical Latin's variant l-allophones, as they do not seem to be diachronically relevant, and harm performance.

[+lo,+syl] > [-front,+back]
[+lo,+syl] > [+front,-back] / __ e̯
{j;w} > [+cons,-son] / __ [+syl] $as per Pope s106 -- Pope considers w and j when not "vocalic" (i.e. part of diphthong) to be fricative
	$ for j, p55 s105c ; for w, p56 s109
$ Note that the sequence u: + w does not seem to occur in Latin 
$ If it did there would be some logical issues with Popeˌs rules -- i.e. s343 she states "beta from b" is effaced after u: 
	$ where of course w (by which she means gamma^w) had already shifted to beta s186 much earlier 
	$ -- of course sound change has no memory! However this issue is moot because u:+w doesnˌt occur in Latin it seems
	
$ CORRECTION : Pope forgets to explicitly say that w is a proper w not ɣʷ after velar consonants hence why we don't end up with tons of kv clusters.
$ To be sure she does note (s186) that "betacism doesn't occur after k" but she doesn't notice that other affects she attriutes to ɣʷ are not occuring in the presence
$ of k -- such as the deletion of the rounded "fricative"/approximant before ʝ (indeed after kw, it is the ʝ that is deleted it seems...) 
ɣʷ > w / [+back,+hi,+cons] __

$ beginning of Late Latin shifts here... 
$As per Popeˌs paradigm, it is considered Late Latin if it occurred before the end of the firth century 

$p144 s359 $~ p73 s156iii --- ns > s, with compensatory lengthening of prior vowel -- must have occurred before nature of length changed
$Pope says "very early" s359
$CORRECTION: now lengthening occurs in the context of non-stressed following syllable, and the n loss is triggered by being between a specifically long vowel and s.
[+syl] > [+long] / __ n̪ s ([-syl])* [+syl,-stres] 
n̪ > ∅ / [+syl,+long] __  s

$p144 s359 $~ p73 s156iii --- rs > s after long vowels, > ss after short vowels
	$must have occurred before nature of length changed
	$ implicitly consecutive vowels are "long" and second becomes so if not-- case of deorsum
$ CORRECTION : we only implement the stipulated shifts occurring after long vowels and two vowel sequences,
$ Because the rs > ss shift after single short vowels seems to only be correct for two lexemes, persica and dorsum.
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > ∅ / [+syl,+long] __ s
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > ∅ / [-cons] [-cons] __ s

$ CORRECTION: long e: before j becomes short

$ the gliding phenomenon below

$p102 s220 (also p73 s156i)  -- yod and w formation -- gliding of unstressed short non-low vowels before other vowels

$ per s220 : yod is lost between e and p,r

$ CORRECTION: before j is consonantalized, dark l emerges from l specifically before consonants (except l)
l > [+back] / __ [+cons,-lat]

j > ʝ / __ [+syl] $as per Pope s105c, 106
$ w, newly from u,o in hiatus is clearly NOT effected by this as per treatment in s374

$p91 s187iia
$ CORRECTION: This seems to only reliably occur after /ɑ/ and /ɑː/ -- this is a better reason why vivum, ovum and nativum are unaffected than "analogy" (which Pope says in s188).
ɣʷ > ∅ / [+syl,+lo] __ [+syl,+round]

$ as per s186iib -- w effaced between k and a rounded vowel
	$ Note most authors interpret this differently, as the delabialization of k
	$ Note also that Pope seems to have missed that his also happend after g?
	$ CORRECTION: does not happen when following vowel is word final -- case of sequo >>>> siue >>> suis
w > ∅ / k __ [+syl,+round] @

$ p115 s261-264 $~ s221 $~ s156i
$ *** Note as per s156i, for Pope this is a "tendency" 
$ the slurring ... of "proparoxytones" ... i.e. where the tonic syllable was followed by two unstressed sylls before hte word coda
$ ... typically concerning those which are common suffixes here.
$ Pope attests this with the Appendix Probi, which was written in the third or fourth centuries but does not say that is when it specifically occurred. 
$ Because of words like "table", we know it probably occurred before lenition of intervocalic b (early second century) but Pope does not confirm this either. 
$ By placing it here before the beginning of betacism, we are giving Pope the benefit of the doubt. 
$ This is also inline with what she states about the -itus,-itum etc group -- she is holding that this phenomenon occurred before hte beginnings
$ 	of palatalization  (s296)
$ Further note : s262b -- Pope notes that sometimes the older forms were restored by preservative analogy via "clerkly influence" 
$ p115 s262a -- effects on -ulus,-ulum,-ula words. Attested for affecting those where preceding cons is k,g,t,p or b. There donˌt seem to be
	$ any words of this type ending in -dulus,-dulum, or -dula. 
$ CORRECTION : -mulum endings also effected (cumulum > comble; tremulum > tremble) 
$ CORRECTION : -rula endings also effected (berula (Gaul.) > berle not bierle) 
$ CORRECTION: -olum,-olus endings also included if not after a labial cons

$ p115 s262b -- effects on the -idus,-idis,-itis etc group : for prior consonsants Pope lists l, g, t, s, k, and r
	$ the most faithful way to render this also in line with Occam's Razor would seem to be [+cons] 
	$ *** NOTE s353 -- seems to imply it was possible for this to NOT occur for some words
	$ note also the frigidus contradiction: s297 & s316 vs. s262ii & s296i
$ CORRECTION: ɪ does not disappear before t at this point as all the affected words (hospitem, comitem, lenditem, limitem) need to eject ə after final vowels are lost
$ CORRECTION: ɪ only disappears before d[+front,-lo] when after a sonorant (magidem must also eject ə -- so cluster must be formed in Gallo-Roman stage)
$ CORRECTION: ɪ before dʊ does not disappear if previous consonant is voiceless, as these will need to eject ə in Gallo-Roman when final vowels are lost (muccidum, nitidum, sapidum, tepidum)
	$ CORRECTION: it DOES disappear before voiced stops though (frigidum)

$ CORRECTION : slur short i between ɣʷ and k 
$ Pope lists avica and avicellum as having been effected by "slurring" in s187i 
	$but doesn't state that i was slurred here explicitly elsewhere
ɪ > ∅ / ɣʷ __ k

$as per p91 s187i -- ɣʷ > w when preconsonantal due to "slurring"
ɣʷ > w / __ [+cons]

$ CORRECTION: a much more effective and thorough way to describe the apparent contexts of deconsonantalization of ɣʷ here...
$ actually covering two shifts
$ it appears that this occurred in all ɑɣʷɪ sequences : navicellam, navicam, avicam, avicellam, Pictavis, etc...
$ Pope (s187i) says this is due to "slurring" but she nowhere else described the "slurring" phenomenon that would have fed the rule in this way
$ Doesn't happen when the posterior ɪ is stressed it seems -- see kˌɑwˈɪkulɑm > ʃəvij
$ Hence this is the most efficient way to represent it...: 
ɣʷ > w / [+lo,+syl] __ ɪ 
$ next, to cover the ɑɣʷɑ sequences (most of these being from Gaulish): bauam, flavam, cavannum. 
$Doesn't seem to happen for -aːre verbs (lava:re) -- this can be represented by only allowing the posterior ɑ to be short
ɣʷ > w / [+lo,+syl] __ [+lo,+syl,-long]

$p91 s186: w>beta. Occurred during the 1st and 2nd century ("Nerβa")
$ CORRECTION : as evidenced by Pope s343 causing errors for 10 words that became β from ɣʷ, t
$ they did not merge this early, and must have merged AFTER that -- instead we send ɣʷ to βʷ 
ɣʷ > βʷ

$p73 s155iia and pp136-137 ss332-336 and p6 s9 : b > β intervocalically or between vowel and r (s372)
$According to s336 this occurred very early at least for the bilabial, 2nd century AD 
$Later authors group all voiced stops together for this shift, but Pope is unclear
$She states (s336) that it is attested earlier for b than the others but is unclear
$However she indicates a shift order in s307i that necessitates velar stop palatalization preceding intervocalic lenition
$So we give her the benefit of the doubt and place the lenition of the rest of the velar stops later,
$Right after the beginning of palatalization.
$ she is not clear about whether her j and w ("fricatives") are sonorant, but we will assume they are NOT
	$... given that she called them fricatives -- this is supported by her trajectory for rubeum > rouge (s676)
b > β / [+syl] __ [+son,-lat,-nas]

$ p115 s263 -- with proparoxytons with intervocalic g, both g and preceding vowel deleted "early" (s263)
	$ given the hypothesized forms listed by Pope, it is clear she thinks this happened before  ɪ > e and ʊ > o 
[+syl,-stres] ɡ > ∅ / [+prim] ([-syl])* __ [+syl,-stres] ([-syl])* #

$ per Pope s185 and s198, combination of vowels that have become adjacent and share the same quality become a single long vowel of same quality
$ in practice this only happens for e'e and o'o. They become tense too. 
$ CORRECTION: o'o made tense.
[+front,-hi,-lo] [+front,-hi,-lo,+prim] > ˈeː
[+round,-hi] [+round,-hi,+prim] > ˈoː

$ Pope notes it did not occur in monosyllabic words 
$ NOTE: as per p97-98 s205i -- unlike Italy and also South Gaul, North Gaul did not see effacement of s and t word-finally,

$ Pope does NOT specify that it becomes nasal at this point -- actually she says the "first nasal vowels in Frnech were a and ai in the tenth century" (s434)

[+syl,+back,+round] > [+hi,+tense] / __ [+nas,+cons]

$ s164-3 $~ s190 $~ s279 $~ s311,312,313,314,315

$ for maintenance -- Pope doesn't account for the fact that this could end up with a j + j + Cons cluster
$ but this is not an interesting error, just a clumsy one -- obviously no such cluster can exist
$ so we bleed it with a special rule... 
$ CORRECTION: any remaining d͡zʲ also ejects j backwards and depalatalizes at this stage

$ {t̪ʲ;d̪ʲ;sʲ;zʲ;n̪ʲ;d͡zʲ} > {j t̪;j d̪;j s;j z;j n̪;j d͡z} -- ABROGATED (see below)

$ CORRECTION: tʲ,  sʲ and dʲ are actually preserved into Old French in a specific position between a palatal continuant cons and i
	$ , but lʲ,nʲ,zʲ are lost at this point
$ ... while tsʲ and rʲ are eliminated also earlier by shifts slightly later than this
$ The evidence is the discover of a new REGULAR RULE by which
	$ (formerly former) palatals see the deletion of following j in jɛʁ segments
		$ at the same time as this occurs for the uncontroversially remaining palatals
			$ those being ʃ,ʒ,ʎ and ɲ at that point
		$ a list to which we add sʲ, tʲ and dʲ which are swiftly eliminated afterward
	$ evidence: tractare > traiter not traitier, laxare > laisser not laissier,
		$ vocita:re > vuider > vider, not vuidier > vidier, 
		$ exfructa:re > effruiter > effriter not effruitier > effritier
		$ but finally plusio:res > plusieurs not plusours, 
	$ the only alternative to this is massive changes in the chronology of 
		$ diphthong developments, which is pretty well substantiated
	$ so this is the best option with regards to Occam's razor
$ sʲ is NEVER preserved in ss though, nor are any of these preserved before a consonant
$ the persistence of sʲ/tʲ/dʲ is specifically both after non-strident palatal consonantal continuants
	$ and before either # or i e̯ r #  - - so it must behave exactly like before when preceded 
		$ by a non-consonantal.

$ s231-3 : Pope is very unsure of the fate of a e̯ when it did not become aj before nasals, but what she settles on is this:

$ syllable length rules of Gallo-Roman (open and stressed =long, else =short) must no longer be effective after this point. 
$ Buckley criticizes this paradigm from Pope.

$ # Example: rika (<Gaulish) appeared became roie under the rounding ei by 1140, but in 1170 we see it attested as raie
	$ and the formation of rayure (raie + ure)  www.cnrtl.fr/definition/raie
$ It is likely the sound used was a rare allophonic sound mostly absent elsewhere in the language
	$ which was neither round enough to be o

	$ therefore ʌ makes a good guess.

ˈu > ˈʌ / __ j ə #

$ CORRECTION: unrounding and lowering of u in uj before j d ə , j ð ə and j ð r ə in late 12th century
$ Pope argues that oi > ai shifting only occurred under Italian influence, and specifically centuries later in Middle French
$ She also argues that ð was lost during the 12th century, not hte end of it. 
$ However, there is textual evidence pointing toward some sort of oj-unroudning occurring where ð was about to leave a hiatus
	$ but NOT where θ would create the necessary context 
$ witrum: voirre in 1174-1187, but becoming "verre" and "warre" in 1200
		$ cre:ta : attested as croie in 1175, but then craie in the root for craiere in 1290
		$ cle:ta : attested as claie in 1306
		$ mone:tam : monoie in 1170 then monnoie in 1245, but attested as monae 1296
$ There are other interpretations of this that are tempting, but do not seem to work 
	$One is that ð and θ disappeared early (as Pope argues), and fed the previous added shift where oj went to ʌj before ə then coda #
$		 However there is an issue with this: Pope and all the relevant literature argue that ð and θ disappeared at the same time
		$ and where it is θ disappearing and not ð to create the environment of ojə#, the shift does not occur
		$ example : ficatum > fojəθ > fwa (foie), not *fɛ (*faie)
		$ example 2 : plicat > plojəθ > plwa (ploie), not *plɛ (*plaie) 
			$ this also would not explain why we see the same pattern in oide words (rigidam > roide >raide) 
				$ except those preceded by labial elements which rerounded ʌ (via > voie, frigida > froide, lampreda > lamproie)
	$Another is that ð and θ disappeared early and there was a global shift where this would have occurred
		$ this works for the ojðə# segments, but not the ojðrə# segments (voirre > verre, attested in 1200; tonitrum > tonerre, etc...)
		$ It appears unrounding before rə only occurs where ð once was, meaning ð really may have survived longer than we thought
	$one way to explain this is that the shift originally manifested in a conservative lower class dialect 
		$ that did not make it into the written form into a bit after it happened 
		$ i.e. it occurred in the late 12th century,
$			early enough to be conditioned on ð just as it was about to vanish when we first see
$			roie become raie and voirre became vairre [1200], but did not become widespread in the writing until around 1300 
				$ when we begin to see craie 1290, monae 1296, claie 1306, etc.)
			$ this also would not explain why there is similar behavior before d (rigidam > roide > raide) 
		$ all exceptions except se:tam can be explained by a rule by which teh former uj is restored under the influence of preceding
			$ labial elements 
$ Like above, it is likely this sound, which saw delayed entrance into the written language except for a few words (raie, verre)
	$ was neither really an a or an o for about a century-- hence ʌ is a good guess, with Canadian raising being a good analog

$ CORRECTION : degemination of rr happens many centuries before Pope says it is
$ this is surprising because Pope has much backing in historical texts describing the language -- however after making this change
$ accuracy improved by a whole point and it appears that a lot of her French historical text-based evidence
$ led her in the wrong direction -- such as asserting that any a before rr would become long (and thus /ɑ/ ultimately -- but this did not
